## Project Overview

*El Corte Inglés – Club del Gourmet*, the premium food and wine division of Spain’s leading department store, specializes in offering high-quality, exclusive products to a discerning customer base. As a *buying team*, we're partnering with the Head of Product and Marketing to extract insights from a Spanish wine dataset and deliver recommendations to improve decision-making across sales, product selection, and marketing strategy.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to analyze the Spanish wine dataset to identify the top 10 premium wines for *El Corte Inglés – Club del Gourmet*, focusing on key hypotheses such as consumer preference for specific regions, the relationship between price and quality, the impact of vintage years on ratings, preference for lower acidity, and regional price differences. By testing these hypotheses, we aim to provide data-driven recommendations that support product selection, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns, ultimately helping the buying, marketing, and operations teams make informed decisions that enhance the premium wine assortment and optimize customer satisfaction.
