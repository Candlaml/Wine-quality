#Deliverables
The main deliverable is a GitHub repository with the name sql-database. It should contain the following:
A README.md file in the root of the repository to document the project containing useful information about the project. Anyone that reads the README should be able to understand the project without having to look through all of the files.
Code and files that demonstrate the data pipeline coverage of acquisition, transformation, loading, analysis, and reporting. This includes:
Database: The exported .sql file should be included with the final schema.
Entity relationship diagram (ERD).
SQL Queries: A compilation of all SQL queries used during the project.
Python files. Remember, when using Python the code must be put in wrapped functions.
At least 1 Jupyter notebook containing the report in full with visualizations.
The report should be comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing, that narrates the story of your data in full. The report should combine text, clean code, meaningful outputs, and engaging visualizations to convey the derived insights and conclusions effectively.
Make sure to modularize your work. The Jupyter notebook report must be distinct from the code responsible for cleaning, acquiring, processing data, etc. Feel free to use multiple Jupyter notebooks, .py or .sql modules for this.
URL of the slides for the presentation:
The presentation (see guidelines below) should summarize your insights and conclusions.
Remember to include your ERD diagram. You should explain it during the presentation, and defend the decisions made.
